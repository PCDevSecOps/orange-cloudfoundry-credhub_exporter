# Credhub Prometheus Exporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orange-cloudfoundry/credhub_exporter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/orange-cloudfoundry/credhub_exporter)

A [Prometheus][prometheus] exporter for [Credhub][credhub]. The exporter currently only exports metrics related to credhub objects, including [certificate](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub/blob/master/docs/credential-types.md) objects (it does not yet provide metrics about the credhub server health such as error rates, response times, or total number of entries).


## Installation

### Binaries

Download the already existing [binaries][binaries] for your platform:

```bash
$ ./credhub_exporter <flags>
```

### From source

Using the standard `go install` (you must have [Go][golang] already installed in your local machine):

```bash
$ go install github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/credhub_exporter
$ credhub_exporter <flags>
```

### Docker

To run the credhub exporter as a Docker container, run:

```bash
$ docker run -p 9358:9358 orangeopensource/credhub-exporter <flags>
```

<!-- ### BOSH -->

<!-- This exporter can be deployed using the [Prometheus BOSH Release][prometheus-boshrelease]. -->

## Usage

### UAA Client

In order to connect to the [Credhub API][credhub_api] a `client-id` and `client-secret` must be provided. The `client-id` must have the `creadhub.read` authority.

For example, to create a new `client-id` and `client-secret` with the right permissions:

```bash
uaac target https://<YOUR UAA URL> --skip-ssl-validation
uaac token client get <YOUR ADMIN CLIENT ID> -s <YOUR ADMIN CLIENT SECRET>
uaac client add prometheus-credhub \
  --name prometheus-credhub \
  --secret prometheus-credhub-client-secret \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities creadhub.read,creadhub.write
```
